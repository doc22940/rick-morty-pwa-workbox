# Rick & Morty PWA Workshop -> Step 2

## Copy Workbox libraries

Take a look at your `package.json`. One of the installed `devDependencies` is the `workbox-cli`. As already mentioned workbox is not a library but a set of libraries. This means that you cannot just install all the libraries with an npm command. However with the help of the `workbox-cli` package we can copy those libraries so that they can be re-copied to the `dist` folder during the build process.

In the [Workbox documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/get-started#importing_workbox) they recommend to import Workbox from the Workbox Content Delivery Network (CDN) but this is not a good practice. Check out [this Jake Archibald's post](https://jakearchibald.com/2018/third-party-css-is-not-safe/) where he talks about third party scripts.

Instead of that we are going to serve the libraries ourselves. First copy them:

```bash
npx workbox copyLibraries src/scripts/workbox-libs
```

## Create the App Shell

An application shell is the minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript powering a user interface. You can think of it as the bundle of code you'd publish to an app store if you were building a native app.

Workbox handles 2 types of caching:

* Precaching: is performed during the service worker installation and it takes a precache manifest.
* Runtime caching: is performed on fetch events.

Be careful not to mistake precache manifest with web app manifest. The precache manifest only specifies the files that are going to be precached by our service worker.

The first thing we need is a file for our custom service worker. Create it in `src/sw-custom.js`.

```javascript
importScripts('/scripts/workbox-libs/workbox-vx.x.x/workbox-sw.js');

if (workbox) {
  console.log(`Yay! Workbox is loaded ðŸŽ‰`);

  workbox.setConfig({
    modulePathPrefix: '/scripts/workbox-libs/workbox-vx.x.x/'
  });

  workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([]);
} else {
  console.log(`Boo! Workbox didn't load ðŸ˜¬`);
}
```

`importScripts()` method belongs to any worker global scope and allowes us to import one or more scripts into the current worker's scope. Fill in the corresponding Workbox version so that this method doesn't fail.

`workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute([])` is just a placeholder. The precache manifest will be generated inside it in our final `dist/sw.js`. So let's generate it.

```bash
npx workbox wizard --injectManifest
```

The Workbox wizard asks a series of questions. You should know the answers. Select all types of files. In the end a `workbox-config.js` file should be created in your project root.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  globDirectory: 'dist/',
  globPatterns: ['**/*.{png,jpeg,html,css,json,ico,js}'],
  swDest: 'dist/sw.js',
  swSrc: 'src/sw-custom.js'
};
```

But you need to do one more thing. Go to `package.json` and add a sequential (non parallel) execution at the end of the "build" script: `npx workbox injectManifest`.

Unleash it.

```bash
npm run build
```

## If you didn't make it

```bash
git checkout step-02-app-shell
git branch step-02-app-shell-mine
```
